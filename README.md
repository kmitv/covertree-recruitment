# Covertree API

## Project Description

The application is designed to manage property records through a GraphQL API. When a new property is created, the app makes an API call to the Weatherstack API to fetch the current weather data for the property's location. This weather data is then stored along with the property details in the Supabase database.

### Solving the Problem

The main challenge was to integrate multiple services (Weatherstack API and Supabase) and ensure seamless communication between them. Here's how the problem was solved:

1. **GraphQL API**: A GraphQL API was implemented using Apollo Server to handle property management operations such as querying, adding, and deleting properties.

2. **Weatherstack Integration**: During the creation of a property, an API call is made to the Weatherstack API to fetch the current weather data for the property's location. This data is then included in the property record.

3. **Supabase Integration**: Supabase is used as the database to store property records. The app interacts with Supabase to perform CRUD operations on the property data.

4. **Testing**: Jest is used as the testing framework to ensure the functionality of the API. Integration tests are written to verify the end-to-end functionality of the property management operations.

5. **Linting**: ESLint is set up to maintain code quality and consistency. The project includes linting scripts to check and fix code style issues.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js (22.1.0)**: JavaScript runtime environment (I specifically used Bun during development)
- **TypeScript**
- **GraphQL**
- **Weatherstack API**
- **Supabase**: Backend as a Service (BaaS) for database storage.
- **Jest**: Testing framework.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I can query all the properties.
2. As a user, I am able to sort the properties by date of creation.
3. As a user, Iâ€™m able to filter the properties list by their city, zip code, and state.
4. As a user, I can query details of any property.
5. As a user, I can add a new property (all properties are within the United States).
6. As a user, I can delete any property.

## Property Fields

- `id`: Automatically generated during creation.
- `city`: Passed via GraphQL mutation argument on creation (e.g., Fountain Hills).
- `street`: Passed via GraphQL mutation argument on creation (e.g., 15528 E Golden Eagle Blvd).
- `state`: Passed via GraphQL mutation argument on creation (abbreviation, e.g., AZ).
- `zipCode`: Passed via GraphQL mutation argument on creation (5-digit, e.g., 85268).
- `weatherData`: Object containing the `current` property from the Weatherstack API call.
- `lat`: Latitude from the Weatherstack API response (e.g., 33.609).
- `long`: Longitude from the Weatherstack API response (e.g., -111.729).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd covertree-api
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your variables as following:
    ```
    SUPABASE_URL=
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
    WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY=
    PORT=

    ```

4. Build and start the server:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

5. To test the application:
    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```

## Example GraphQL Queries and Mutations

### Query All Properties
```graphql
query {
  properties {
    id
    city
    street
    state
    zipCode
    weatherData {
      current {
        temperature
        weather_descriptions
      }
    }
    lat
    long
  }
}
```

### Query Property Details
```graphql
query {
  property(id: "property_id") {
    id
    city
    street
    state
    zipCode
    weatherData {
      current {
        temperature
        weather_descriptions
      }
    }
    lat
    long
  }
}
```

### Add a New Property
```graphql
mutation {
  addProperty(
    city: "Fountain Hills",
    street: "15528 E Golden Eagle Blvd",
    state: "AZ",
    zipCode: "85268"
  ) {
    id
    city
    street
    state
    zipCode
    weatherData {
      current {
        temperature
        weather_descriptions
      }
    }
    lat
    long
  }
}
```

### Delete a Property
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteProperty(id: "property_id") {
    id
  }
}
```
